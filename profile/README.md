## What is Dodi Repacks?

DODI is a well-known game repacker, like Fitgirl, who constantly works on recently released games. He has been uploading since 2018 and is widely known for:

- **Medium compression level repacks**, which drastically reduce install time and system resource usage.  
- The use of **trusted, clean files** in all his releases.

### The Problem with Torrents  
There is just one problem - his active community is not big, thus most people "hit and run" his repacks without seeding them. (Averagely popular releases get their seeders dropped to digits like 2 or 5 just one week after their release.)  

This makes him unreliable on the torrent manner of downloading his repacks, for which he uses certain **file-hosters** to keep his releases online always. (Which is, btw, a huge relaxation for people who live in countries where torrenting is illegal.)  

### File-Hosters: A Double-Edged Sword  
If you want to download a certain release and find out that the torrent is dead, you might want to download from those file-hosters, which is quite a nasty task to do, since those hosters:  

- Implement **unlawful measures** like ads and popups in their pages for extra income.  
- (Let alone Dodi paying a lot for their storage.)  
- Prove a **headache** for people who aren’t experienced.
